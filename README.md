# Mesh Infotech Ltd. Network Design  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Welcome to the **Mesh Infotech Ltd.** network design documentation! This project outlines a structured networking plan for our **9-floor office building**, ensuring **efficiency, scalability, and fault tolerance**.

## 🌐 Network Topology  

Our network is designed with **three different topologies** to balance **performance and fault tolerance**:  

- 🔗 **Mesh Topology** → Used for **Floors 1-4** (Ensures high redundancy and fault tolerance)  
- ⭐ **Star Topology** → Used for **Floors 5-7** (Easy maintenance & centralized management)  
- 🔄 **Ring Topology** → Used for **Floors 8-9** (Efficient data transmission with minimal cabling)

## 📡 IP Addressing Scheme  

- 📌 **Class A Public IPv4 Addressing** (Following classful addressing)  
- 📌 **Each floor receives a unique subnet** to avoid conflicts  
- 📌 **Proper segmentation for security and easy management**  

## 🚀 Routing Strategy  

- 🛠 **Static Routing** is implemented for inter-floor communication to ensure predictable and controlled data flow.  
- 🔄 **Routers are configured manually** for each subnet to **improve security** and **reduce complexity**.  
- 🔍 **Gateway addresses** assigned to routers for efficient routing between floors.
